00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:27.258
That's it.

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:32.263
Can I just, you know,
look at it for a minute?

00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:35.308
You're an artist, Sid.

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:39.270
You're telling me
you're just gonna walk out of here

00:00:39.353 --> 00:00:40.980
and I'm never gonna see it again?

00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:43.316
There's a good chance of that, yes.

00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:47.987
Most guys, you know, for the first one,
they start with something small.

00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:50.990
"Mom", girlfriend's initials,
something like that.

00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:52.408
Not you.

00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:56.913
You get a full set of sleeves,
all in a couple of months.

00:00:56.996 --> 00:00:59.957
Takes guys a few years
to get the ink you got.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.335
I don't have a few years.

00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:05.463
Wish to hell I did.

00:01:59.517 --> 00:02:01.060
The vault. Open it.

00:02:01.144 --> 00:02:03.729
We can't. The branch manager's not here.

00:02:05.648 --> 00:02:08.401
- Where is he?
- It's lunchtime. He's at White Castle.

00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:09.485
White Castle?

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.948
It's a fast-food restaurant.
They serve those little square burgers.

00:02:14.407 --> 00:02:15.783
I know what it is.

00:02:18.077 --> 00:02:20.538
I'm not playing games. Open it.

00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:23.082
Sir, you have a half a million dollars cash
in your bag.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.793
Don't you think it would be better if...

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.765
This is the police.
You are completely surrounded.

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:43.978
Put down your weapon.

00:02:45.813 --> 00:02:48.316
Put down your weapons now!

00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:56.157
Rarely in the case of armed robbery
do we hear a plea of "No Contest."

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.785
- Are you sure about this, Mr. Scofield?
- I'm sure, Your Honor.

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:01.954
Your Honor, we'd like to recess
if we could.

00:03:02.038 --> 00:03:04.123
My client's a bit confused at the moment.

00:03:04.207 --> 00:03:06.292
- I'm not, Your Honor.
- He is, Your Honor.

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:09.170
Perhaps you should heed
your representation's advice.

00:03:09.253 --> 00:03:11.756
Take some additional time
to consider your response.

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.300
I've already done that, Your Honor.

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.266
I'll retire to my chambers
to determine sentencing.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.435
Court's recessed until 1 :30.

00:03:26.312 --> 00:03:27.647
Okay, come on, let's go.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.981
Uncle Mike.

00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:32.401
I didn't want you to come.

00:03:32.818 --> 00:03:34.278
Go home, LJ.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.530
I didn't want you to see this.

00:03:44.205 --> 00:03:47.375
- He's not going to take this well.
- Can you blame him? He's your nephew.

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:48.668
He's beginning to get the idea

00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:51.963
that anybody he attaches himself to
is going to end up in prison.

00:03:52.046 --> 00:03:56.217
And he's not the only one
who is starting to feel that way, Michael.

00:03:56.425 --> 00:03:59.136
- Will you give us a minute?
- One minute.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.305
Don't you understand?

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.057
You just put the book
in that woman's hand

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.142
and she's going to lob it at you
like a grenade.

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:07.603
Justice and punishment
are the same thing to her.

00:04:07.687 --> 00:04:08.729
I know.

00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:11.440
Then will you please tell me
what's going through your head?

00:04:11.524 --> 00:04:14.068
- We've been over this.
- I've known you my entire life.

00:04:14.151 --> 00:04:16.404
You don't have a violent bone
in your body.

00:04:16.487 --> 00:04:19.198
- And I know you didn't need the money.
- Veronica.

00:04:19.282 --> 00:04:21.200
Why won't you let me help you?

00:04:21.284 --> 00:04:24.370
You've been good to me my whole life.
You have.

00:04:25.329 --> 00:04:27.957
But you got to let me deal with this, okay?

00:04:29.083 --> 00:04:33.796
Given your lack of prior criminal conduct,
I am inclined toward probation.

00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:36.757
However, the fact
that you discharged a deadly weapon

00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:39.719
during the commission of the crime
suggests malice to me.

00:04:39.802 --> 00:04:42.054
For that reason, I find it incumbent

00:04:42.138 --> 00:04:45.182
that you see the inside of a prison cell,
Mr. Scofield.

00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:48.561
It says here that you've requested
to be incarcerated

00:04:48.644 --> 00:04:50.688
somewhere near your home
here in Chicago.

00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:52.231
I'm willing to honor that.

00:04:52.315 --> 00:04:54.734
- The closest Level 1 facility to...
- Level 1?

00:04:54.817 --> 00:04:56.861
That's maximum security, Your Honor.

00:04:56.944 --> 00:04:59.989
I would ask counsel
to refrain from interrupting me.

00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:02.742
As I was saying, the closest Level 1 facility

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:04.785
would be Fox River State Penitentiary.

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:08.080
As for the term of your sentence,
I'm setting it at five years.

00:05:08.164 --> 00:05:10.666
You'll be eligible for parole
in half that time.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.960
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

00:05:25.431 --> 00:05:28.100
You people will step inside
the door. Check yourself for bugs.

00:05:28.184 --> 00:05:30.728
When you hear the knock, step out.
Keep the line moving.

00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:33.189
We ain't got all day to get this done.

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:34.523
No talking in line.

00:05:34.607 --> 00:05:36.067
Go. Move it.
We've got less than five minutes.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.610
- Keep that line moving.
- Move it.

00:05:37.693 --> 00:05:39.528
- Keep it moving.
- Move it right now. Let's go.

00:05:39.612 --> 00:05:40.946
Move, move.

00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:44.033
Next guy in the bank.
Left. Let's go.

00:05:44.116 --> 00:05:47.995
- Name and back number.
- Scofield, Michael. 94941.

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:50.623
- You a religious man, Scofield?
- Never really thought about it.

00:05:50.706 --> 00:05:53.042
Good, 'cause the Ten Commandments
don't mean a box of piss in here.

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:54.585
We got two commandments and two only.

00:05:54.668 --> 00:05:57.004
The first commandment is
you got nothing coming.

00:05:57.088 --> 00:05:59.840
- What's the second commandment?
- See commandment Number 1.

00:06:00.633 --> 00:06:01.801
Got you.

00:06:02.385 --> 00:06:04.470
You talking out the side of your neck?

00:06:04.553 --> 00:06:08.057
- Come again?
- I said, are you being a smart ass?

00:06:08.516 --> 00:06:10.976
I'm just trying to fly low,
avoid the radar, boss.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.104
Do my time and get out.

00:06:14.313 --> 00:06:16.440
There isn't any flying under my radar.

00:06:17.024 --> 00:06:18.484
Good to know.

00:06:39.213 --> 00:06:41.715
Hey, can a brother get some
air-conditioning up here, cuz?

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:43.676
It's hotter than a crack ho's mouth, man.

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:47.054
Shit, to hell with the a.c., man.
Give me the crack ho.

00:06:54.145 --> 00:06:56.188
Yo, Fish, what you looking at?

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:58.983
You look kind of pretty
to be up in here, man.

00:06:59.775 --> 00:07:00.943
Fish!

00:07:02.486 --> 00:07:04.822
Suggest you take a seat, Fish.

00:07:05.573 --> 00:07:08.117
Ain't nothing to do up in here
but serve time.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.035
Ain't nobody gonna serve it for you.

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.595
Welcome to Prisneyland, Fish.

00:07:54.163 --> 00:07:57.917
- You want to talk about it?
- It's not worth talking about.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.420
- If it's keeping you up, it is.
- It's just...

00:08:02.087 --> 00:08:03.714
It's nothing, you know.

00:08:04.924 --> 00:08:06.175
Michael's case.

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:10.054
- You did the best you could.
- Yeah, but he didn't.

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:14.225
He just sort of rolled over.
He didn't put up a fight.

00:08:14.308 --> 00:08:16.227
It is not like him. I...

00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:19.605
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be talking about him.

00:08:19.688 --> 00:08:22.650
Hey, if it's on your mind,
it's on your mind, right?

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.778
Good night.

00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:37.414
All lanes start coming out.

00:08:44.046 --> 00:08:45.965
Trey Street Deuces got the hoops.

00:08:46.048 --> 00:08:48.133
Norteños got the bleachers.

00:08:48.467 --> 00:08:50.302
Woods got the weight pile.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.763
CO's got the rest.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.642
I'm telling you, the guards
are the dirtiest gang in this whole place.

00:08:56.725 --> 00:09:00.104
The only difference
between us and them is the badge.

00:09:00.187 --> 00:09:03.232
- Who's the pet lover?
- He'll deny it, but he's D. B. Cooper.

00:09:03.315 --> 00:09:06.944
Parachuted out of a plane 30 years ago,
with $1 .5 million in cash.

00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:09.738
- Doesn't look like the type.
- Who does?

00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:11.865
Hey, what up, Wholesale?

00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:13.993
- You okay?
- Gonna be greater later.

00:09:14.076 --> 00:09:15.077
Yeah.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.455
- What you doing with this fish, man?
- This my new cellie.

00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:21.375
Wholesale's got it wired up
at the commissary.

00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:23.294
Anything you want, he can get it for you.

00:09:23.377 --> 00:09:25.796
You keep handing out my jacket,
I swear I'm gonna bust your grape.

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:28.340
Man, you couldn't bust a grape in Napa
with a set of cleats on.

00:09:28.424 --> 00:09:30.634
- What are you talking about?
- Now, you want to bump your gums...

00:09:30.718 --> 00:09:32.928
Oh, no, no.
Now you're talking, talking, talking...

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.040
I'm looking for someone.

00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.794
- A guy named Lincoln Burrows.
- Linc the Sink?

00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:08.464
- Is that what they're calling him now?
- Yeah.

00:10:08.547 --> 00:10:12.259
As in, he'll come at you with everything
but the kitchen, snowflake.

00:10:12.551 --> 00:10:13.802
Where can I find him?

00:10:15.554 --> 00:10:19.058
Man killed the Vice President's brother.
In a month, he's getting the chair.

00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:21.810
Which means no one up this river
is more dangerous than him

00:10:21.894 --> 00:10:23.312
'cause he's got nothing to lose now.

00:10:23.395 --> 00:10:25.230
What are they gonna do, kill him twice?

00:10:25.314 --> 00:10:27.066
- Is there a way I can get to him?
- Oh, no.

00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:30.361
The only time those boys get out
is for chapel and PI.

00:10:30.444 --> 00:10:33.155
- PI? What's that?
- Prison Industry.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.074
The guys that get along get to work.

00:10:35.157 --> 00:10:38.619
You know, painting, scrapping,
making mattresses, you name it.

00:10:39.662 --> 00:10:41.747
I wouldn't get excited though
if I were you, Fish.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.415
You ain't sniffing none of PI.

00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:46.210
- Why is that?
- 'Cause John Abruzzi runs it.

00:10:47.252 --> 00:10:50.756
- "John Abruzzi" John Abruzzi?
- "John Abruzzi" John Abruzzi.

00:10:51.131 --> 00:10:53.676
Why you want to see Burrows
so bad anyhow?

00:10:57.137 --> 00:10:59.098
Because he's my brother.

00:11:21.787 --> 00:11:23.539
- They denied the motion.
- Then do it again.

00:11:23.622 --> 00:11:26.792
I can't. That's it. May 11.
That's the date, man.

00:11:27.126 --> 00:11:30.212
That's the date they,
you know, execute me.

00:11:30.796 --> 00:11:32.047
I know.

00:11:37.678 --> 00:11:41.306
- I didn't kill that man, Michael.
- The evidence says you did.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.643
I don't care what the evidence says,
I didn't kill him.

00:11:44.727 --> 00:11:45.978
Swear to me.

00:11:48.188 --> 00:11:49.857
I swear to you, Michael.

00:11:56.113 --> 00:11:59.450
But how did they get it wrong then?
The courts, the appeals?

00:11:59.533 --> 00:12:01.285
Don't know. Don't know.

00:12:02.161 --> 00:12:06.039
All I keep thinking, looking back on it,
is that I was set up.

00:12:06.457 --> 00:12:10.961
And whoever it was that set me up wants
me in the ground as quickly as possible.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.302
- What's another word for "love"?
- What's the context?

00:12:18.385 --> 00:12:19.636
Oh, you know,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.847
the "I love you so much
I ain't never knocking over

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.891
"a liquor store again" context.

00:12:23.974 --> 00:12:25.684
Except, you know, classy.

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:29.438
I'm proposing to my girl
if you got to know.

00:12:29.521 --> 00:12:30.564
In a letter?

00:12:30.647 --> 00:12:33.358
- You got a better way?
- Face to face works pretty good.

00:12:33.442 --> 00:12:36.361
This place ain't exactly the romantic spot.

00:12:36.862 --> 00:12:39.114
I'm gonna have her get on
the Staten Island Ferry.

00:12:39.198 --> 00:12:41.617
Then once she can see
the Empire State Building,

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.661
she opens the letter.
It's like almost being there.

00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:48.040
Except for the fact that I won't be there.

00:12:48.123 --> 00:12:51.543
- Try "passion."
- Passion, passion. That's dope.

00:12:51.794 --> 00:12:52.961
Passion.

00:12:54.797 --> 00:12:57.382
How do you spell that? Is it P-A-S-H?

00:12:59.301 --> 00:13:00.385
No "H"?

00:13:06.975 --> 00:13:09.269
- LJ, hold up.
- Hold up?

00:13:10.062 --> 00:13:12.231
I don't know if I can go through with this.

00:13:12.314 --> 00:13:14.483
Everything's gonna be fine.

00:13:14.566 --> 00:13:15.818
Trust me.

00:13:26.078 --> 00:13:27.746
- We understand each other then?
- Yeah.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.708
- Friday. Not Saturday, not Sunday. Friday.
- It's totally understood.

00:13:31.792 --> 00:13:34.253
I don't want $1 00s, I don't want $5s,
I don't want $1 s.

00:13:34.336 --> 00:13:36.380
I know, I know. $1 0s and $20s only.

00:13:46.765 --> 00:13:48.016
It's on.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.488
Police!

00:14:24.678 --> 00:14:27.472
Abruzzi, I need you to hire me at PI.

00:14:29.266 --> 00:14:30.309
Beat it.

00:14:31.184 --> 00:14:33.145
Maybe you ought to hear
what I got to say.

00:14:33.228 --> 00:14:35.147
You got nothing I need.

00:14:36.982 --> 00:14:38.775
Wouldn't be too sure of that.

00:14:39.776 --> 00:14:41.153
My mistake.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.655
Just what I need.

00:14:43.989 --> 00:14:45.324
A duck.

00:14:46.158 --> 00:14:47.659
PI, Abruzzi.

00:14:47.743 --> 00:14:50.704
You might find I can be
of more assistance than you think.

00:14:53.165 --> 00:14:54.625
Mull it over.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.878
Come find me when you're ready to talk.

00:15:04.843 --> 00:15:08.472
All right, guys, pick it up.
I want to get home tonight.

00:15:08.555 --> 00:15:09.848
Maggio.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:17.856
Yeah, so?

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.901
That's the son of a bitch
that fingered Abruzzi.

00:15:20.984 --> 00:15:22.361
That's Fibonacci?

00:15:23.737 --> 00:15:27.783
- I thought the punk was gone forever.
- Evidently somebody found him.

00:15:27.866 --> 00:15:31.495
- Somebody messing with us?
- This you're not gonna believe.

00:15:35.332 --> 00:15:36.625
What is it?

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.216
Tattoo looks fresh. Hold that.

00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:48.053
I guess being a diabetic,
you don't mind needles.

00:15:48.345 --> 00:15:50.097
I'm Michael, by the way.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.474
Scofield. I read your report.

00:15:52.557 --> 00:15:55.519
- And you are?
- Dr. Tancredi will do.

00:15:55.936 --> 00:15:57.521
Tancredi like the Governor?

00:15:59.564 --> 00:16:01.358
You're not related, are you?

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.571
Wouldn't think you'd find the daughter
of "Frontier Justice" Frank

00:16:06.655 --> 00:16:08.115
working in a prison.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.242
As a doctor no less.

00:16:10.492 --> 00:16:13.578
I believe in being part of the solution,
not the problem.

00:16:15.372 --> 00:16:17.749
"Be the change
you want to see in the world."

00:16:21.586 --> 00:16:22.671
What?

00:16:24.297 --> 00:16:26.591
Nothing. That was just my senior quote.

00:16:26.717 --> 00:16:29.761
That was you? This whole time
I was thinking it was Gandhi.

00:16:30.762 --> 00:16:32.097
You're very funny.

00:16:32.681 --> 00:16:36.101
Sit tight. Put direct pressure on that.
I'll be back in a sec.

00:16:50.782 --> 00:16:54.036
So, how do we play this? You hook me up
with a few weeks' supply?

00:16:54.119 --> 00:16:56.455
Nice try. No hypos on the floor.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.791
I'm the farthest thing from a junkie.
Trust me.

00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.084
I got news for you, Michael.

00:17:01.168 --> 00:17:03.920
"Trust me" means absolutely zero
inside these walls.

00:17:04.004 --> 00:17:07.632
The only way you're getting that insulin
is if I'm administering it.

00:17:07.716 --> 00:17:10.427
I guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other then.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.636
I guess so.

00:17:24.775 --> 00:17:27.152
- We're all clear on the Burrows execution.
- Good.

00:17:27.235 --> 00:17:30.822
Except for one thing.
Bishop McMorrow is not in the fold.

00:17:33.658 --> 00:17:35.994
He's got a lot of influence
with the Governor.

00:17:36.203 --> 00:17:38.413
They went to prep school
together apparently.

00:17:39.247 --> 00:17:41.124
Look, the closer it gets,

00:17:41.416 --> 00:17:45.003
the more I'm worried that the bottom
is gonna fall out of this whole thing.

00:17:49.216 --> 00:17:52.677
Maybe it's time you arranged a visit
with the good bishop then.

00:17:53.845 --> 00:17:57.057
Look, in one month it'll all be over.

00:17:58.225 --> 00:18:02.521
"The Son of man must be delivered
into the hands of sinful men,

00:18:02.604 --> 00:18:06.191
"and be crucified,
and the third day rise again."

00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:09.861
"And they remembered his words,"
and so should you.

00:18:10.445 --> 00:18:13.198
Good day, gentlemen.
May God be with you.

00:18:18.161 --> 00:18:20.372
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:18:25.168 --> 00:18:26.378
Michael?

00:18:28.713 --> 00:18:30.215
Let's go. Come on, man.

00:18:32.717 --> 00:18:36.096
- Why?
- I'm getting you out of here.

00:18:36.471 --> 00:18:39.182
Burrows, roll it up. Happy hour's over.

00:18:39.724 --> 00:18:43.395
- It's impossible.
- Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.071
Too formal.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.075
Too greeting card.

00:18:57.576 --> 00:19:00.453
Well, we got to make a decision
sooner or later, you know.

00:19:00.537 --> 00:19:03.999
- We have time.
- We don't, actually.

00:19:04.875 --> 00:19:08.128
I mean, at some point,
we got to pull the trigger on this thing.

00:19:08.211 --> 00:19:09.880
I don't want to rush this.

00:19:09.963 --> 00:19:12.632
We're only gonna do it once.
We have to get it right.

00:19:17.804 --> 00:19:21.433
- Honey, can I ask you something?
- Of course.

00:19:22.601 --> 00:19:25.437
- Are you putting this off?
- What do you mean?

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.607
- I mean, are you having second thoughts?
- No.

00:19:29.441 --> 00:19:31.818
Honey, no. I'm not.

00:19:32.777 --> 00:19:35.614
I don't know, but I just
can't help thinking this is about...

00:19:35.697 --> 00:19:36.823
It's not.

00:19:38.283 --> 00:19:39.492
I love you,

00:19:40.368 --> 00:19:42.162
and I want to be your wife.

00:19:46.458 --> 00:19:49.836
- "Passion"? What were you thinking?
- Hey, you went for it.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.256
She probably thinks
I went sissy up in here. "Passion."

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.384
You know, got more than one syllable,
too much talking.

00:19:56.468 --> 00:19:58.678
That's me from now on.
"One Syllable Sucre".

00:19:58.762 --> 00:19:59.971
Yes. No.

00:20:00.138 --> 00:20:01.556
Love. Hate.

00:20:01.932 --> 00:20:03.642
- Love.
- Give it time.

00:20:03.725 --> 00:20:06.561
Are you kidding? I proposed to her.

00:20:06.728 --> 00:20:10.440
That doesn't take time. Si or no.
One syllable, man.

00:20:13.109 --> 00:20:16.029
She's supposed to come around
for a conjugal on Tuesday.

00:20:16.112 --> 00:20:19.407
She's always calling me beforehand,
letting me know she's coming.

00:20:19.491 --> 00:20:22.077
This time, man, I ain't heard a peep.

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:24.663
You spooked her.

00:20:25.622 --> 00:20:28.833
Scofield, get it together.
Pope wants to see you.

00:20:32.921 --> 00:20:34.381
No good, Fish.

00:20:34.839 --> 00:20:36.967
No one gets an audience with the Pope.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.053
Not unless he's real interested
in what you got going on.

00:20:41.096 --> 00:20:44.849
Top of your class at Loyola.
Magna cum laude, in fact.

00:20:46.351 --> 00:20:49.062
I can't help wondering
what someone with your credentials

00:20:49.145 --> 00:20:50.939
is doing in a place like this.

00:20:52.274 --> 00:20:54.651
Took a wrong turn
a few months back, I guess.

00:20:55.068 --> 00:20:57.195
You make it sound like a traffic infraction.

00:20:57.279 --> 00:21:00.073
Like all you did was turn the wrong way
up a one-way street.

00:21:00.156 --> 00:21:02.242
Everyone turns up one sooner or later.

00:21:05.704 --> 00:21:07.497
The reason I called you here,

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:13.295
I noticed in your I-file, under occupation,
you put down unemployed.

00:21:14.254 --> 00:21:15.839
That's not true now, is it?

00:21:18.967 --> 00:21:21.886
I know you're
a structural engineer, Scofield.

00:21:25.307 --> 00:21:28.226
Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.021
as a monument
to his undying love for his wife.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.857
My wife is quite fond of the story.

00:21:34.399 --> 00:21:36.818
It appeals to the romantic in her.

00:21:38.778 --> 00:21:42.365
Being married to someone in Corrections,
terrible job.

00:21:42.449 --> 00:21:44.534
Wouldn't wish it on anyone.

00:21:44.617 --> 00:21:49.039
And yet, in 39 years,
my wife has never complained.

00:21:49.622 --> 00:21:52.751
And the worst part of it is,
I've never thanked her.

00:21:54.419 --> 00:21:58.923
So, because I couldn't say it,
I thought, you know, I could build it.

00:22:00.633 --> 00:22:03.428
Come June, it's our 40th anniversary.

00:22:05.555 --> 00:22:07.098
But, here, look.

00:22:07.432 --> 00:22:10.435
You see, the problem is, I build any more,

00:22:11.102 --> 00:22:14.105
it's all gonna come down
like a house of cards.

00:22:14.189 --> 00:22:17.317
That's where I was hoping
you could be of assistance.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.237
And for the favor, I can offer you
three days of work a week in here,

00:22:21.321 --> 00:22:23.406
and it'll keep you off the yard.

00:22:30.497 --> 00:22:31.748
I can't do it.

00:22:33.833 --> 00:22:37.170
Son, it's better for me
to owe you one in here

00:22:37.253 --> 00:22:40.673
than it is for you to owe me one,
I can promise you that.

00:22:40.757 --> 00:22:42.550
I'll take my chances.

00:22:45.428 --> 00:22:47.430
Then we're through here.

00:22:47.931 --> 00:22:48.973
Guard!

00:22:51.935 --> 00:22:53.561
Two pounds of pot?

00:22:54.479 --> 00:22:56.731
What were you trying to do, set a record?

00:22:56.815 --> 00:22:59.818
It's not funny, LJ.
You could be going to jail.

00:23:01.486 --> 00:23:04.656
It's pretty obvious to me
you need some guidance.

00:23:07.951 --> 00:23:09.035
Thanks.

00:23:11.371 --> 00:23:12.956
From who? Old Daddy Warbucks?

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:16.751
- Give him a chance. He's a good man.
- We got nothing in common.

00:23:16.835 --> 00:23:19.087
Oh, where's this coming from, LJ?

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.382
Last semester, you were getting
almost all A's and now...

00:23:25.593 --> 00:23:28.430
- It's your father, isn't it?
- I don't have a father.

00:23:28.513 --> 00:23:31.808
It wasn't an immaculate conception,
honey, trust me.

00:23:34.686 --> 00:23:36.855
Maybe it's time we went and saw him.

00:23:37.939 --> 00:23:39.023
Mom.

00:23:39.232 --> 00:23:40.316
Ma.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:41.693
Don't.

00:23:41.776 --> 00:23:45.238
I'm about as excited by the prospect
as you are, but something's got to give.

00:23:45.321 --> 00:23:49.075
You have got too much potential
to be screwing up your life like this.

00:23:52.912 --> 00:23:55.999
What if they'd sent you
to Taylorville or Marion and not here?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.252
I think I'd be doing the same thing
I'm doing in here.

00:23:59.335 --> 00:24:01.546
Eating Jell-O, drinking Kool-Aid.

00:24:01.629 --> 00:24:03.423
I know what you're doing.

00:24:03.506 --> 00:24:07.010
It's not the luck of the draw
that you're in here with Lincoln.

00:24:07.093 --> 00:24:09.387
You forget I know you, both of you.

00:24:09.512 --> 00:24:13.266
You two have the most dysfunctional idea
of love I've ever seen.

00:24:13.349 --> 00:24:15.768
What, he beats you up
to keep you off the streets,

00:24:15.852 --> 00:24:18.605
so you get yourself
tossed into Fox River with him?

00:24:18.688 --> 00:24:20.857
To what? Save him?

00:24:23.443 --> 00:24:26.321
I deserve to know.
I loved him as much as you did.

00:24:26.404 --> 00:24:29.032
Past tense for you, maybe. Not me.

00:24:29.908 --> 00:24:32.744
I gave him a shot
when I got back from college. I did.

00:24:32.827 --> 00:24:34.829
Even with all the stuff
that was going on with him,

00:24:34.913 --> 00:24:37.749
I did everything I could to make it work
and he threw it away.

00:24:37.832 --> 00:24:41.711
You ever think maybe he was hurt
that you left in the first place?

00:24:41.794 --> 00:24:43.129
Don't do this.

00:24:43.213 --> 00:24:45.798
Whatever it is you're doing, don't do it.
There's a better way.

00:24:45.882 --> 00:24:47.258
I'm already appealing your case.

00:24:47.342 --> 00:24:48.468
I told you to leave that alone.

00:24:48.551 --> 00:24:50.595
I've gotten in touch with the diocese
about Lincoln.

00:24:50.678 --> 00:24:54.682
- The bishop may be able to help.
- That won't stop it. It'll only delay it.

00:24:58.228 --> 00:25:02.148
You want to do something?
You find out who's trying to bury him.

00:25:04.609 --> 00:25:06.736
Nobody's trying to bury him.

00:25:06.819 --> 00:25:09.948
- The evidence was there.
- The evidence was cooked.

00:25:12.742 --> 00:25:14.911
Visiting hours are now over.

00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:21.834
Take care of yourself.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:27.840
Someone wants him dead, Veronica.
Something more is going on here.

00:25:28.758 --> 00:25:31.427
This is desperation, Michael.
You're grabbing at straws.

00:25:31.511 --> 00:25:34.847
- You're in denial.
- Maybe. But I can't watch him die.

00:25:34.973 --> 00:25:36.349
I won't do that.

00:26:06.129 --> 00:26:07.171
Gentlemen.

00:26:07.255 --> 00:26:10.842
What is it about the Burrows situation
that I can help you with?

00:26:10.925 --> 00:26:14.846
It's our understanding that you
have great influence with the Governor.

00:26:14.929 --> 00:26:19.017
I wouldn't say it's great or influence.
We're friends.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.520
It's also our understanding
that you oppose the death penalty.

00:26:22.604 --> 00:26:24.522
I'm a man of God. How could I not?

00:26:24.606 --> 00:26:27.525
In this case, we're hoping
you'll suspend that position.

00:26:27.609 --> 00:26:29.277
At least temporarily.

00:26:29.569 --> 00:26:32.864
If the inmate appeals to me
for intervention,

00:26:33.364 --> 00:26:35.033
how can I turn my back on him?

00:26:35.116 --> 00:26:38.036
You have a habit
of answering a question with a question.

00:26:38.119 --> 00:26:41.539
And you have a way of asking questions
that beg more questions.

00:26:46.169 --> 00:26:50.006
- Are you saying you won't do it?
- I'm not a man to equivocate.

00:26:53.259 --> 00:26:56.095
You're what, 62 years old now,
Your Excellency.

00:26:56.179 --> 00:26:57.221
That's right.

00:26:57.305 --> 00:26:58.931
I would assume then
that you'd be well-versed

00:26:59.015 --> 00:27:00.850
in how our government's
tax system works.

00:27:00.933 --> 00:27:04.395
Taking personal capital gains
under the church's tax shelter...

00:27:04.937 --> 00:27:07.523
That'd be fraud, wouldn't it,
Your Excellency?

00:27:08.232 --> 00:27:11.903
I will not be cowed
into forsaking my beliefs.

00:27:12.445 --> 00:27:14.739
Not by you or anyone else.

00:27:15.615 --> 00:27:16.908
Admirable.

00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:19.535
Good day, Your Excellency.

00:27:20.244 --> 00:27:21.746
Mr. Kellerman.

00:27:23.206 --> 00:27:27.251
What is it about this case
that the Secret Service is so interested in?

00:27:27.335 --> 00:27:29.796
The man killed
the Vice President's brother.

00:27:37.512 --> 00:27:39.263
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

00:27:39.597 --> 00:27:42.975
Someone found Fibonacci.
I'm looking at the photos right now.

00:27:43.309 --> 00:27:47.522
Son of a bitch has got a beard, sunglasses,
Witness Protection if I ever saw it.

00:27:47.939 --> 00:27:49.399
Who was this someone?

00:27:49.482 --> 00:27:52.276
I don't know.
There's no return address on the envelope.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:57.073
Just... this folded-up bird made of paper.

00:27:59.492 --> 00:28:02.120
- Like origami?
- Yeah, like that.

00:28:02.787 --> 00:28:04.163
Like origami.

00:28:38.573 --> 00:28:40.575
You're Charles Westmoreland, right?

00:28:40.658 --> 00:28:43.870
- Do I know you?
- Knew your wife before she passed.

00:28:44.328 --> 00:28:46.539
- You knew Marla?
- You mean Ann?

00:28:47.498 --> 00:28:50.710
- How'd you know her?
- We taught together in Boston.

00:28:50.835 --> 00:28:53.713
- East Farmington.
- You mean West Wilmington?

00:28:54.505 --> 00:28:57.216
No more tests, I promise.

00:28:58.843 --> 00:29:01.053
Seems you know everything about me.

00:29:01.137 --> 00:29:03.306
- Who are you?
- Michael Scofield.

00:29:03.765 --> 00:29:07.393
- How'd you get it in here?
- First off, she's not an it.

00:29:07.935 --> 00:29:10.438
She's Marilyn, and she's grandfathered

00:29:10.521 --> 00:29:12.774
back from the days
when prisoners were allowed

00:29:12.857 --> 00:29:15.234
a creature comfort or two.

00:29:15.318 --> 00:29:17.361
Heard you were D. B. Cooper.

00:29:18.696 --> 00:29:21.866
Every new fish comes in here,
first thing they hear

00:29:21.949 --> 00:29:24.535
is that Charles Westmoreland's
D. B. Cooper.

00:29:24.911 --> 00:29:27.079
I'll tell you like I tell them.

00:29:28.122 --> 00:29:29.999
You want the Cooper story?

00:29:30.082 --> 00:29:32.877
I can't give it to you 'cause I'm not him.

00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:35.963
That's too bad. Sort of wish it was true.

00:29:36.172 --> 00:29:37.590
Man's a legend.

00:29:37.673 --> 00:29:40.551
Nowhere near as much
as I wish it were true, friend.

00:29:40.635 --> 00:29:43.387
I'd have $1 .5 million waiting for me
on the outside.

00:29:46.557 --> 00:29:49.101
I'd put some grass under them
if I were you.

00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:53.648
This thing would go a whole lot easier
if you'd just hire me.

00:29:53.731 --> 00:29:55.525
What is this all about?

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.237
Say you were able
to get outside those walls.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.406
Would you have the people in place
to make sure you disappeared forever?

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.243
- What do you care?
- Just curious.

00:30:05.368 --> 00:30:08.538
- Where's Fibonacci?
- That's not the way it works.

00:30:13.584 --> 00:30:16.504
They come at me, John,
I'm coming after you.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.548
I doubt it.

00:30:45.992 --> 00:30:47.493
All right.

00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:53.499
On the ground! On the ground!

00:30:53.583 --> 00:30:55.126
Get on the ground!

00:30:56.794 --> 00:31:01.424
I totally misjudged you, Scofield.
I didn't think you were the agitating type.

00:31:01.507 --> 00:31:04.218
Behavior like that
will not be tolerated in my prison.

00:31:04.302 --> 00:31:05.595
Ninety days in the SHU.

00:31:05.678 --> 00:31:07.930
That ought to be enough time
to convince you of that fact.

00:31:08.014 --> 00:31:09.640
- Ninety days?
- That's right.

00:31:17.732 --> 00:31:19.734
Something you want to say?

00:31:20.067 --> 00:31:21.485
It's just...

00:31:22.153 --> 00:31:24.280
I'm not of much value to you in the SHU.

00:31:24.363 --> 00:31:26.824
- Value?
- The Taj.

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.827
It'd be a shame for the eighth wonder
of the modern world

00:31:29.911 --> 00:31:32.705
to collapse because the stress
isn't properly propagated.

00:31:32.788 --> 00:31:35.499
- Properly propagated?
- Properly propagated.

00:31:35.583 --> 00:31:37.460
The joints are overloaded.

00:31:37.543 --> 00:31:39.795
They won't provide anywhere near
the sheer strength

00:31:39.879 --> 00:31:42.173
the completed structure will need.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.967
How much work are we talking?

00:31:45.051 --> 00:31:47.345
- You want it by when, June?
- Yes.

00:31:47.678 --> 00:31:50.514
Then we better get started,
wouldn't you say?

00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:18.751
Who's there?

00:32:36.852 --> 00:32:41.357
Bishop McMorrow was killed last night.
Someone shot him while he was sleeping.

00:32:41.857 --> 00:32:45.027
- I thought you'd want to know.
- Thanks.

00:32:52.451 --> 00:32:54.078
Michael was right.

00:33:23.524 --> 00:33:25.484
Sink, you got a visitor.

00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:39.582
He was arrested.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.753
- For what?
- Possession of marijuana.

00:33:47.131 --> 00:33:50.051
I figured he could use
some fatherly advice before it's...

00:33:51.677 --> 00:33:53.679
- Gone forever?
- I didn't mean that.

00:33:53.763 --> 00:33:56.265
I know you didn't. Thanks, Lisa.

00:33:57.975 --> 00:33:59.060
Sit down.

00:34:04.315 --> 00:34:05.566
Dope, huh?

00:34:05.983 --> 00:34:07.318
Using or dealing?

00:34:08.778 --> 00:34:10.321
What's the difference?

00:34:10.404 --> 00:34:13.783
Then what? You think it gives you
some kind of street cred?

00:34:15.493 --> 00:34:18.245
You got a piece of the good life.
Take advantage.

00:34:19.163 --> 00:34:21.665
Look, I get it, the whole thing.

00:34:22.333 --> 00:34:24.168
She drags me in here,

00:34:24.585 --> 00:34:27.671
you give me a big speech,
I walk away a changed man.

00:34:27.922 --> 00:34:31.592
Straight A's, Harvard,
grow up and be a dentist.

00:34:32.301 --> 00:34:34.011
It's better than being here.

00:34:35.387 --> 00:34:39.183
You got to realize who's getting punished
when you're doing the things you're doing.

00:34:39.266 --> 00:34:42.269
You think it's me. It's you.
I did the same thing.

00:34:42.353 --> 00:34:46.148
Punished the old man 'cause he was gone.
Look what it got me.

00:34:49.276 --> 00:34:51.821
I'm not asking you to love me.

00:34:51.904 --> 00:34:54.740
I already screwed up that chance long ago.

00:34:54.824 --> 00:34:56.951
I'm asking you to love yourself.

00:34:57.034 --> 00:34:59.370
You can still put the brakes on this thing.

00:35:01.247 --> 00:35:03.707
So, that's what fatherly advice is like.

00:35:04.625 --> 00:35:06.377
Where are you going?

00:35:06.877 --> 00:35:08.379
I got homework.

00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:11.423
They're putting me to death, LJ.

00:35:11.507 --> 00:35:13.425
In a month's time, I'll be dead.

00:35:14.135 --> 00:35:15.344
You get that?

00:35:17.138 --> 00:35:18.639
You're already dead to me.

00:35:44.165 --> 00:35:45.249
Yes.

00:35:45.875 --> 00:35:48.586
What? You mean, "yes" yes?

00:35:49.086 --> 00:35:50.462
Yes, yes!

00:35:53.924 --> 00:35:55.593
- There's just one thing.
- Of course.

00:35:55.676 --> 00:35:58.470
- Mama wants us to wait till you get out.
- Of course, mi amor.

00:35:58.554 --> 00:36:00.973
- Only we have to get married in a church.
- Okay, está bien.

00:36:01.056 --> 00:36:02.224
A Catholic church.

00:36:02.308 --> 00:36:05.352
Wouldn't want to mess
with the Catholic roots, would we?

00:36:11.108 --> 00:36:13.777
- You went to Loyola.
- You've been checking up on me.

00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:15.654
I like to get to know my patients.

00:36:15.738 --> 00:36:18.115
I went to Northwestern.
Graduated two years after you did.

00:36:18.199 --> 00:36:21.577
Maybe we met before.
You know, drunk, out at a bar somewhere.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.995
I would've remembered.

00:36:23.078 --> 00:36:24.872
- That a compliment?
- No.

00:36:28.209 --> 00:36:29.293
What?

00:36:29.376 --> 00:36:32.087
Your blood glucose
is at 50 milligrams per deciliter.

00:36:32.171 --> 00:36:34.048
- So?
- It's hypoglycemic.

00:36:34.298 --> 00:36:37.176
Your body's reacting to the insulin
like you're not a diabetic.

00:36:37.259 --> 00:36:41.138
- You sure it's Type I diabetes you got?
- Ever since I was a kid.

00:36:41.722 --> 00:36:44.683
All right. Not experiencing
any tingling sensation, cold sweats?

00:36:49.063 --> 00:36:50.147
Infirmary.

00:36:50.564 --> 00:36:51.649
Yes.

00:36:53.025 --> 00:36:54.693
Yeah, I did.

00:36:55.945 --> 00:36:57.988
No, I did and I do. I need to go.

00:36:59.281 --> 00:37:00.366
Okay.

00:37:01.325 --> 00:37:05.788
Great. Well, I'll call him after lunch then.
Thanks. I'm with a patient. Okay.

00:37:05.871 --> 00:37:08.290
I'd like to run some tests
next time you're in.

00:37:08.374 --> 00:37:11.961
Last thing I want is to be administering
insulin to a man who doesn't need it.

00:37:12.044 --> 00:37:13.462
Yeah, sure.

00:37:14.129 --> 00:37:15.214
Okay.

00:37:22.179 --> 00:37:25.516
- How'd you get here by the way?
- Oh, you know.

00:37:26.558 --> 00:37:28.519
I don't. That's why I asked.

00:37:29.019 --> 00:37:31.522
- You know. Hector.
- What?

00:37:32.147 --> 00:37:35.484
I didn't have any money for the bus,
so he offered me a ride.

00:37:35.567 --> 00:37:37.194
He was really sweet.

00:37:38.862 --> 00:37:41.615
- Honey, he's just a friend.
- No, he's not just a friend.

00:37:41.699 --> 00:37:44.910
I know Hector. I know men.
Men and women can't be friends.

00:37:44.994 --> 00:37:48.831
A guy doesn't drive a girl 500 miles across
state lines because he wants to be friends.

00:37:49.957 --> 00:37:51.667
- Casanova, wrap it up.

00:37:52.209 --> 00:37:55.337
Hey, you got nothing
to worry about, okay?

00:37:55.879 --> 00:37:59.550
- It's you I'm marrying.
- It's not you I'm worried about.

00:38:02.261 --> 00:38:03.929
Sixteen more months.

00:38:12.646 --> 00:38:13.814
I love you.

00:38:25.409 --> 00:38:27.578
Be easy, son, all right?

00:38:33.417 --> 00:38:36.170
Sucre tells me you're the local pharmacy.

00:38:39.757 --> 00:38:41.759
- What you need, man?
- PUGNAC.

00:38:42.092 --> 00:38:44.219
I only speak English, white boy.

00:38:44.303 --> 00:38:45.429
It's an insulin blocker.

00:38:45.512 --> 00:38:48.223
Standard over-the-counter variety
you can get at any pharmacy.

00:38:48.307 --> 00:38:51.310
- You can get that at Medical then.
- I can't get that at Medical.

00:38:51.393 --> 00:38:52.603
Why not?

00:38:52.686 --> 00:38:55.773
Because they're already
giving me insulin shots.

00:38:56.899 --> 00:38:59.276
You're one mixed-up cracker,
you know that?

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.028
Can you get it for me or not?

00:39:01.862 --> 00:39:05.324
Only if you tell me why is it you want
to keep going back up to Medical

00:39:05.407 --> 00:39:07.701
to get an insulin shot
which you don't need.

00:39:07.785 --> 00:39:09.411
I like the ambiance.

00:39:10.621 --> 00:39:12.122
Are we in business?

00:39:27.262 --> 00:39:28.639
Scofield.

00:39:28.722 --> 00:39:29.973
I don't know what you did,

00:39:30.057 --> 00:39:32.851
but Abruzzi wanted me
to give you this PI card.

00:39:32.935 --> 00:39:36.397
Congratulations.
You just joined the ranks of the employed.

00:39:52.496 --> 00:39:53.872
Kudos, Fish.

00:39:54.581 --> 00:39:56.166
You got spine.

00:40:02.131 --> 00:40:04.425
All right, cons, break it down!

00:40:06.552 --> 00:40:08.345
Move it, guys.

00:40:20.149 --> 00:40:22.067
Saw Veronica came by yesterday.

00:40:22.151 --> 00:40:24.278
- Still engaged to that guy?
- Yep.

00:40:24.695 --> 00:40:27.739
- Could've been me.
- If you hadn't self-destructed.

00:40:29.032 --> 00:40:31.452
You think I meant to knock up Lisa Rix?

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.745
I was just being stupid. Hurt.

00:40:35.873 --> 00:40:40.002
- Shouldn't have pushed her away, though.
- You pushed everyone away.

00:40:40.085 --> 00:40:43.422
I'm an anchor.
All I'll do is drag them down with me.

00:40:48.802 --> 00:40:50.304
Why did you hire him?

00:40:50.387 --> 00:40:53.891
Keep your friends close,
your enemies closer.

00:40:59.313 --> 00:41:03.150
- You mean what you said earlier?
- I'm not here on vacation, trust me.

00:41:04.568 --> 00:41:07.529
Getting outside these walls
is just the beginning.

00:41:07.613 --> 00:41:09.323
You're gonna need money.

00:41:12.284 --> 00:41:13.744
I'll have it.

00:41:14.203 --> 00:41:17.873
And people on the outside.
People that can help you disappear.

00:41:18.248 --> 00:41:19.791
I've already got them.

00:41:20.584 --> 00:41:22.461
They just don't know it yet.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:31.428
Look, whatever you got going on,
fill me in 'cause I'm in the dark here.

00:41:32.596 --> 00:41:36.308
Chaparral Associates got the contract
to retrofit this place in '99.

00:41:36.391 --> 00:41:37.726
$4 million contract.

00:41:37.809 --> 00:41:41.146
Head partner couldn't crack it,
so he subcontracted out.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.482
An under-the-table sort of deal
with a former associate.

00:41:43.565 --> 00:41:46.443
That guy was one of the partners
in my firm.

00:41:48.695 --> 00:41:50.489
We basically ghostwrote the whole plan.

00:41:50.572 --> 00:41:53.659
Crossed the t's, dotted the i's,
grouted the tiles.

00:42:02.793 --> 00:42:05.128
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that.

00:42:06.713 --> 00:42:08.257
I've got them on me.

00:42:12.302 --> 00:42:13.637
Are you kidding me?

00:42:17.224 --> 00:42:19.309
Am I supposed
to be seeing something here?

00:42:19.393 --> 00:42:20.811
Look closer.

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:27.710
